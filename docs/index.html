<h1 id="demo-tips">demo-tips</h1>
<p>To deliver a compelling demo, it is useful to be able to draw the
audience’s attention to specific parts of the screen as you talk about
them.</p>
<p>A couple of methods to achieve this are:</p>
<ol class="incremental" type="1">
<li>Zoom in on the part of the screen you want to draw attention to</li>
<li>Use a laser pointer</li>
</ol>
<p>Assuming you are presenting on a videoconferencing platform such as
Zoom or Google Meet, here is how you can do it:</p>
<h3 id="zoom-in">Zoom in</h3>
<p>This requires setting up Accessibility in Mac’s System settings.</p>
<p>Be sure to set: - Use scroll gesture with modifier keys to zoom in -
Modifier key: Control - Zoom style: Picture in Picture - Click on Size
and Location, and increase the size to cover the entire screen</p>

<p>Now when you share your screen in Zoom or Google Meet, share your
entire desktop. If you are using multiple displays, make sure to set the
secondary display to mirror the built-in display.</p>

<p>Then use the Control+Scroll gesture on the mouse to zoom in on the
part of the screen you want to draw attention to. You can also pan
around the screen by moving the mouse.</p>
<p>On Google Meet, there is an additional step needed to workaround an
issue. By default, Google Meet will not show the zoomed in effect to the
audience.</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">google-meet-workaround</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Workaround: Choose the icon on the top bar. Change the Presenter
Overlay to Small and back to Off. Now the zoomed in effect will be
visible to the audience.</p>
<h3 id="laser-pointer">Laser pointer</h3>
<p>Zoom has a built-in laser pointer feature that becomes available when
you share your screen. It also lets you draw on the screen.</p>
<p>With Google Meet, there is no built-in laser pointer feature. As a
workaround, you can use the laser pointer feature in Google Slides, and
move your mouse around in other applciations.</p>
<p>To access Google Slides’ laser pointer, switch to presentation mode
and choose from the options in the bottom left corner of the screen.</p>
